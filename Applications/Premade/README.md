# Premade Software Archive
For the sake of convenience for people attempting to set up a CP/M system and don't want to go hunting for software, here is a bunch of software that I have collected that I can confirm functions with Ishkur. Most of it comes from publicly available archives, so I am assuming it to be abandonware. If you happen to own any of this software and want it removed, please reach out to me!

By default, this software is meant to be dropped into an NFS system.

## Drive A:
This mainly contains system utilities plus some archive / compression utilities. The version of INIT.COM is built for the NABU. The TE.COM editor is also included.

## Drive B:
Drive B User 0 contains PTXPLAY plus PT3 files. The version of PTXPLAY is for the NABU. User 1 contains a bunch of Kaypro-style text games that are known to work.

## Drive E:
This drive contains a bunch of programming utilities spread out over 4 users. Most of the major stuff is here; HiTech C, Turbo Pascal, MBASIC, FigForth, BASCOM, and a Z80 assembler. 

## Drive F:
Contains WordStar plus some extras. It isnâ€™t CP/M without WS.COM!
